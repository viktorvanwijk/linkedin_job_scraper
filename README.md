# What?
LinkedIn job scraper with custom title and description filters, and a GUI.

# Why?
The LinkedIn search engine is broken. It keeps showing (promoted) vacancies that are not related to the search query. For example, using the query 'python' results in 1000+ new vacancies every day. This would be fine if they didn't include stuff like 'Filling team employee' at some supermarket, 'Dishwasher employee' at some restaurant, or software jobs related to other languages.

# How?
By using HTML scraping on LinkedIn's guest job search.

# When?
Whenever.

# Who?
Just me.

# Required packages
- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- pandas
- PyQt5 (optional)

# GUI example
